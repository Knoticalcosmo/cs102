            <dt><b>Extreme Hatha Yoga</b></dt>
            <dd>This class will push the limits of human willpower. this 60-minute class will have you stretching over beds of hot coals and needles. there will be a meditaion session at the end of the class for you to figure out how to ignore the pain. This class is not reccomended for anyone and we are sure that someone will shut us down for this.</dd>

            <dt><b>Restorative Yoga</b></dt>
            <dd>if you are indeed looking for some good yoga then go 3 blocks down and have a nice time... you won't find that here</dd>
